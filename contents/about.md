## about me

I grew up in Xi'an, China. I received my Bachelor's degree in Physics from Nanjing University and I continued studying Biophysics at Univ. of Maryland at College Park and received the Ph.D. in 2019. Asides from my academic research, I like coding, math and exploring ideas of using machine learning to analyze data. I also love to take photos. I primarily take films but sometimes digital as well.

## about my research

My current research focuses on understanding 1) how do the chromosomes fold and move in the confined space of cell nucleus 2) the heterogeneity of chromosomes architecture and its role in their biological functions 3) how the molecular motors (such as Kinesins, Myosins, Dyneins et al) work together as teams. My research methods are theoretical and computational, involving equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, polymer physics, computer simulations and machine learning.

## about this site

* I occasionally [blog](https://guang-shi.com/posts/) about side projects, interesting problems encountered in my research and other stuff. My old blog is [here](https://biophyenvpol.wordpress.com/).

* You can check my photos at the [photography page](https://guang-shi.com/gallery/) or at my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/guang_shi_stefan/).

* The site logo is the character of my last name **时** written in the ancient style - [**篆书**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_script). It is made using Inkscape by myself.
